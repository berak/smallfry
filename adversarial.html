  <h2>trying to fool facenet with noise ;)</h2>
  sad as it is, we cannot backpropagate through opencv's dnn layers, <br>
  but already a simple hillclimber is enough to demonstrate adversarial noise.<br>
  (the "distorted" image is "I", on the right"): <p>
  <img id="zz" src="img/adverse.jpg"></img><br><p>
  we extract features from the face images in the usual way, the outcome is a 128x1 float vec:<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/berak/c67575f0f21119c200e36f7467539154.js"> </script>
  then we can start our attack, add a minimal incremental amount of noise at a time<br>
  see how it goes. if it didn't get better, we just discard it<p>
  after ~25000 tries, the feature distance between the 2 different persons is indeed smaller<br>
  than the distance between the 2 images of the same person on the left.<br> WIN!
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/berak/86b054dc0df36fc06049a0db0adb9ead.js"> </script>
  it takes more noise, but we can make it predict "beaver", while it sees an ant, even:<p>
