  <h2>photometric stereo</h2>
  i stumbled about <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/sam/">a nice idea</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/NewProggie/Photometric-Stereo/">github repo</a> ..<p>
  this is an easy setup to acquire decent depth / 3d (half)models for small, real world objects,<br>
  using a dark room, a shining sphere and a pointlight src(e.g. a pocketlight).<p>
  it's a bit limited (to small objects, indoor), but you do not need a stereo camera for this.<br>
  below are the image, the normals, and the depth map:<p>
  <img src="img/photometric.png"></img><p>
  set them up next to each other, make an image, and split it into halves, for ~20 varying light positions<br>
  (look at the holes in the car's front window - i clearly forgot to sample some light directions !)<br>
  the algorithm will try to reconstruct normals and depth from the sampled sphere reflection on the left for the image on the right.<br>

  <img src="img/model.18.png"></img><p>
  there is a maximum intensity point in each sphere image, we can cast a ray from there to the camera.<br>
  the inverted matrix of those light direction vectors will be used to transform the intensities at that pixel in lightspace for the normals computation:<p>

  `x/z` and `y/z` from the normal form separate gradient fields.<br>
  once, whe have the gradients, we can setup the depth map:<p>
